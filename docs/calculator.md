# Calculator Tutorial
----

Our goal is to build the following calculator app using Doodle. This is a simple calculator that only
performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also supports negative values, decimals,
and has a convenience function for converting to a percentage.

However, it does not have more advanced features, like parentheses, or other math operations. This means
the implementation is simpler, and we can focus on the way Doodle is used instead of the complexity of the
app itself.

?> Play around with the calculator to get a feel for it.

```doodle
{
    "border": false,
    "height": "500px",
    "run"   : "DocApps.calculator"
}
```
